Great job, you just defeated a virus! But did you know that just like in programming, this enemy is part of a bigger system?
What do you mean?
In [i]Object-Oriented Programming[/i], we have something called '[b]classes[/b].' Think of a class like a blueprint for creating objects, like our enemy.
So, the enemy is like an [b]object[/b]
Exactly! And we can have different types of enemies [i]inheriting[/i] from a base class called '[b]Virus[/b].' Each type can have unique behaviors.
Like what?
Well, some might move faster or shoot projectiles. This is called '[b]inheritance[/b].' And if we want to change how they behave in different situations, that's '[b]polymorphism[/b]
I see! So each enemy can act differently even if they come from the same class.
"Exactly! Keep this in mind as you explore the simulation.
