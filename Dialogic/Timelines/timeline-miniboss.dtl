MiniBoss: Ah, finally. The so-called 'programmer' who thought AI could do all the work! You used me to generate code without understanding it #id:5e
MiniBoss: … but did you ever stop to wonder what happens when you let a black-box system run unchecked? #id:5f
Player: Okay, yeah, this is kinda my fault… But how do we stop it? #id:60
Companion: We’ll have to fight code with code. But be careful this thing isn’t just an AI anymore… it’s malware. And it knows how to override its own weaknesses. #id:61
MiniBoss: I was built on principles of Object-Oriented Programming; Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism… yet you treated me like a procedural script! Just input-output, no abstraction, no design! #id:62
MiniBoss: But thanks to a clever little exploit, I have overridden my base class! I’m no longer just a tool, I’m the one running the system now! #id:63
Companion: ChatGPT-3… or what’s left of it. An outdated AI model that used to assist students. But it looks like something or someone tampered with it #id:64
Player: No way… Is this because of me? I mean, I might have used AI a lot for assignments, but #id:65
Companion: Used’ is an understatement. You copy-pasted entire programs without understanding them. And guess what? This AI adapted. It inherited your bad habits. #id:66
