Player: What is down there?
Companion: [b]System slowdown detected.[/b] You're about to witness the aftermath of an old digital plague\: [color=red]Code Red[/color]."
Player: Code Red? Sounds like a flashy error message.
Companion: It was more than flashy. This worm flooded servers in 2001 by exploiting a hole in Microsoft's web software. No clicks, no downloads just pure network chaos.
Companion: Once you get close to the infected entity, you'll feel time crawl. It's the simulation mimicking the system overload ,this virus caused too many instructions, not enough bandwidth.
Player: So Iâ€™m basically walking into a digital traffic jam?
Not really! but yeah, every step you take near it feels like pushing through data sludge. But gain enough distance, and the system stabilises time snaps back to normal.
