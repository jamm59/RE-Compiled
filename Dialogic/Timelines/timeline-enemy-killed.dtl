Companion: Great job, you just defeated a virus! But did you know that just like in programming, this enemy is part of a bigger system? #id:35
Player: What do you mean? #id:36
Companion: In [i]Object-Oriented Programming[/i], we have something called '[b]classes[/b].' Think of a class like a blueprint for creating objects, like our enemy. #id:37
Player: So, the enemy is like an [b]object[/b] #id:38
Companion: Exactly! And we can have different types of enemies [i]inheriting[/i] from a base class called '[b]Virus[/b].' Each type can have unique behaviors. #id:39
Player: Like what? #id:3a
Companion: Well, some might move faster or shoot projectiles. This is called '[b]inheritance[/b].' And if we want to change how they behave in different situations, that's '[b]polymorphism[/b] #id:3b
Player: I see! So each enemy can act differently even if they come from the same class. #id:3c
Companion: "Exactly! Keep this in mind as you explore the simulation. #id:3d
