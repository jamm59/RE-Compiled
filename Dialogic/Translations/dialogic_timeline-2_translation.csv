Text/16/text,"Hello, Player. Welcome to the Computing simulation."
Text/17/text,Whoa! Who are you? And what’s happening to me?!
Text/18/text,"I am your [b]Personal Learning Assistant[/b], a program designed to guide you."
Text/19/text,"You attempted to bypass learning with AI. Now, you must [b]truly understand[/b] computing to escape."
Text/1a/text,So… I’m stuck here?
Text/1b/text,"Not forever. If you complete the required tasks, you will regain control or move forward"
Text/1c/text,Tasks? What kind of tasks?
Text/1d/text,"You’ll progress through different levels, just like a student advancing through university, learning key computing concepts along the way."
Text/1e/text,"You’ll interact with binary data, construct logic gates, optimise algorithms, and even battle real-world-inspired viruses that corrupt computer systems"
Text/1f/text,"Wait… what do you mean by ""computing simulation""?"
Text/20/text,This world is built on the core principles of computer science.
Text/21/text,"So, I have to… code my way out?"
Text/22/text,More like learn how everything in a computer actually works. From the smallest bits and bytes to the more complex systems.
Text/23/text,And what happens if I fail?
Text/24/text,"Let’s just say you won’t like the results. But don’t worry! I’ll be here to guide you through every step. Now, let’s get started."
