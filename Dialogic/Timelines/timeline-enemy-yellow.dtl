Companion: [b]Alert.[/b] System congestion increasing. You’re entering a zone affected by [color=red]Mydoom[/color].
Player: Another virus? What’s this one do, shut down everything?
Companion: It spread like wildfire in 2004, one of the fastest ever. Didn’t destroy things outright. It just... choked the system, drowned it in noise, and opened silent backdoors.
Companion: In this simulation, you'll feel it as data bottlenecks. The more infected zones you pass, the more lag stacks up. It's subtle at first... then it hits hard.
Companion: You won’t see dramatic effects here. But if things feel off like too many entities, slightly delayed responses that’s the echo of Mydoom. Subtle sabotage
Player: So it's like a ghost haunting the system without being loud about it.
Companion: Exactly. Sometimes, the worst infections are the quiet ones.
