Text/67/text,See that Ferret? I’ve patched a [b]remote signal[/b] to it. Think of it like a connected node in a network
Text/68/text,So I can control it?
Text/69/text,"For a limited time, yes. Guide it to  find a way to disable one of the lasers above. It’s like sending a command packet through a network. direct, fast, and just long enough to get the job done. Just don’t stray too far, or the signal drops"
Text/6a/text,"Oh and the signs that say [b]NPC AROUND[/b]? They’re signal markers. If you spot one, it means there’s a controllable entity in range. Keep an eye out."
