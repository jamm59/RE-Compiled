Player: What's this machine for? Is this some kind of control panel?
Companion: That’s a [color=yellow]Terminal Control[/color]. 
Companion: Think of it as your remote command center in this simulation.
Companion: These terminals allow you to [b]activate platforms, unlock doors, and manipulate the environment[/b] remotely.
Companion: Just like in real-world computing, sometimes you need a command-line interface to take control when direct interaction isn’t possible.
Companion: You’ll find these all around the map—sometimes, they’re the only way forward. Try using it!
