Companion: Hello, Player. Welcome to the Computing simulation.
Player: Whoa! Who are you? And what’s happening to me?!
Companion: I am your [b]Personal Learning Assistant[/b], a program designed to guide you.
Companion: You attempted to bypass learning with AI. Now, you must [b]truly understand[/b] computing to escape.
Player: So… I’m stuck here?
Companion: Not forever. If you complete the required tasks, you will regain control or move forward
Player: Tasks? What kind of tasks?
Companion: You’ll progress through different levels, just like a student advancing through university, learning key computing concepts along the way.
Companion: You’ll interact with binary data, construct logic gates, optimise algorithms, and even battle real-world-inspired viruses that corrupt computer systems
Player: Wait… what do you mean by "computing simulation"?
Companion: This world is built on the core principles of computer science.
Player: So, I have to… code my way out?
Companion: More like learn how everything in a computer actually works. From the smallest bits and bytes to the more complex systems.
Player: And what happens if I fail?
Companion: Let’s just say you won’t like the results. But don’t worry! I’ll be here to guide you through every step. Now, let’s get started.
