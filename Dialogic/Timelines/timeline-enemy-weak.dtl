Player: What was that? You have flying enemies now? #id:45
Companion: [b]Low-level anomaly detected.[/b] Looks like you're dealing with an old annoyance\: a joke virus. #id:46
Player: Joke virus? That doesn’t sound too dangerous. Or didn't seem to be. #id:47
Companion: It’s not. But it is incredibly [i]annoying[/i]. These things were designed to pop up fake alerts, reverse controls, or blast sound files at random. No real harm, just chaos. #id:48
Companion: In this simulation, you’ll probably experience flickers, fake messages, maybe even reversed buttons. It’s like being trolled by the OS itself. #id:49
Companion: So I’m getting punked by malware. Great. #id:4a
Companion: Exactly. Not every threat is lethal. Some just want to waste your time and make you question reality. #id:4b
