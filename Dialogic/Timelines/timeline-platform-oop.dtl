Companion: This elevator works just like the last platform we used. They all inherit from a base Platform class #id:6b
Player: Like how the virus enemies came from the same Virus class? #id:6c
Companion: Exactly! The base Platform class defines common traits, things like movement and activation. Then different platforms, like this elevator, can add their own unique behaviors. #id:6d
Player: So the elevator extends Platform but adds vertical movement? #id:6e
Companion: Yep! And just like enemies can behave differently while sharing a base class, platforms can too. Thatâ€™s the power of inheritance! #id:6f
